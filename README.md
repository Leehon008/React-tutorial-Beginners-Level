### Learn React without all the distractions. This course will stick to the fundamentals, and guide you through the creation of your first app.

A lot of React newcomers tend to get hung up on external dependencies like webpack, and redux. While tools like this are great they tend to add additional complexity when starting out. 

In these lessons I will be avoiding all these distractions, and sticking to React fundamentals, and guiding you through the creation of your first app.

### Some of the topics covered include:

Elements and Components
Working with JSX
State and Lifecycle
Working with Forms
Creating Dumb/Stateless Components
Building your first App
In addition to the above I’ve also included two bonus videos on React rendering, and updates. If you have ever wanted to learn a bit about how React works under the hood these are for you.

After taking this course, you’ll have a solid foundation in the fundamentals of React, and will be confident enough to move onto more advanced topics, which I hope to cover in future courses.

## What knowledge & tools are required?

JavaScript, HTML, and CSS fundamentals are required
Not required, but experience with JavaScript ES6+ is beneficial
No prior experience with React is required
